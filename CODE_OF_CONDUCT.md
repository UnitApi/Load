# Community Code of Conduct

**Version 1.0
16 Feb 2022**


## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as community members, contributors, committers, and project leaders pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.


## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

Self Development
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

Community development
*   Showing empathy using welcoming and inclusive language towards other community members   
*   Focusing on what is best for the community and project development


### Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## Our Responsibilities

With the support of the Softreck Company (the "Staff"), project committers and leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project committers and leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the Softreck project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include posting via an official social media account, or acting as a project representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project committers, leaders, or the EMO.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Staff at info(at)softreck.dev. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The Staff is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project committers or leaders who do not follow the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the Staff.
